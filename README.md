# Density_Functional_Theory_concept_and_determine_Germanium_solid_properties
Density Functional Theory concept had been explained and tackled in this paper. Moreover, a useful software called Quantum Espresso had been installed and used to do some calculation on the Germanium semiconductor to determine some of its properities. In addition to that, I use some python code files to deal with the Quantum Espresso software.
