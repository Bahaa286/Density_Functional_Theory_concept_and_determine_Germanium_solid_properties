# Density Functional Theory concept and determine Germanium solid properties

## Description

Density Functional Theory concept had been explained and tackled in this paper. Moreover, a useful software called Quantum Espresso had been installed and used to do some calculation on the Germanium semiconductor to determine some of its properities. In addition to that, I use some python code files to deal with the Quantum Espresso software. 
We can run the script.sh in DFT project folder to get the output data files and run the python file 'DFT project'/'python-codes'/plot.py to plot the energy bands. Finally, from python code in 'DFT project'/'calculate_E_vs_a' which is calculation.py we can run the command python3.py >> data.csv in LINUX to get the relation of the total energy with the lattice constant. 

## Paper

The paper that summaries and have the details for all calculations results is shown in the (document.pdf) file
